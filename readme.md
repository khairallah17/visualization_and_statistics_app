# Python Project Setup and Execution Guide

This README provides instructions on how to set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the Python project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```
git clone [URL-of-your-git-repository]
cd [repository-name]
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment in the project directory:

```
python -m venv venv
```

This command will create a new directory `venv` in your project folder.

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment. The activation command differs based on your operating system.

- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

You should now see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### Step 4: Install Requirements

Install the project dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the `requirements.txt` file is present in the root directory of your project and contains all the necessary packages.

## Running the Project

With the virtual environment activated and all dependencies installed, you can now run the project:

```
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of the main Python script of your project.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

Once you are done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```
deactivate
```

This command will return you to the global Python environment.
